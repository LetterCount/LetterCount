### Hello! 👋

I am a 13 year old developer who makes projects solely for teaching myself coding.

I dedicate hours just trying to perfect the things nobody will see.

If you like my projects, please star them! It gives me motivation to actually work on them. ⭐️

I accept [donations](https://www.cash.app/corefulz), and of course you don't have to, but it would make me happy!
